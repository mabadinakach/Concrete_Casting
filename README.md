# Concrete Casting

An app that it is designed to tell you when is the right time to do the concrete casting based on the weather (weatherapi.com)

## Getting Started

**Make sure to allow location priviliges to the app to retrieve the weather from the current location.**

### iOS

In order to run the project you will have to clone the repo and open it up on Xcode (ios/Runner/Runner.xcodeproj) (Sidenote: you will not be able to run it in your device unless you have a developer account, if you have one just change the Signing Profile), and just hit the run button.

### Android (not tested yet)

In order to run the project for android open it up in Android Studio, connect your phone and hit the run button.

## Motivation

I have been always part of the architecture world, since I was a little kid my dad took me a lot of times to see his buildings, here I learned the basics of it. Now that I am older and some of my friends are studying architecture, we were wondering why do people that want to do the casting have to check the weather and make sure that it will not rain in a few hours, so we came up with an idea of developing an app that will tell you the best time of the day to do your casting based on the weather.
